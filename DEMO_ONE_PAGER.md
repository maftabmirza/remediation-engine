# 🚀 AIOps Remediation Engine - One-Page Demo Guide

> **AI-Powered Incident Response Platform**
> From Alert to Resolution in Minutes

---

## 💎 What It Is

**An intelligent operations platform that automates incident response using AI**

Integrates with Prometheus/Alertmanager → Analyzes alerts with AI → Provides actionable remediation → Enables interactive troubleshooting

---

## 🎯 The 60-Second Pitch

Modern infrastructure generates thousands of alerts. **Traditional approach**: Manual triage, documentation search, repetitive troubleshooting = **45+ minutes MTTR**.

**Our solution**: Agentic AI analyzes alerts in real-time, fetches relevant context from knowledge bases, metrics, and logs, then provides step-by-step remediation with an integrated web terminal.

**Result**: **10-minute MTTR** (78% reduction), $1.4M annual savings per 100-person team.

## ⚡ Key Features (Show in Demo)

### 1️⃣ Agentic AI Analysis (30 seconds)
```
Alert arrives → AI uses 10 specialized tools →
Searches knowledge, queries metrics, checks logs →
Delivers root cause + remediation steps
```
**Demo**: Trigger alert, watch AI analyze in real-time

### 2️⃣ Intelligent Rules Engine (20 seconds)
```
Auto-analyze critical alerts
Manual review for warnings
Ignore known noise
```
**Demo**: Show rule matching in action

### 3️⃣ Interactive Chat (40 seconds)
```
Ask: "Was this service healthy yesterday?"
AI: [Queries Prometheus] "99.8% uptime, 0.4% errors..."

Ask: "Show me the error logs"
AI: [Queries Loki] "Found 12 errors, main cause..."
```
**Demo**: Live conversation with AI about an incident

### 4️⃣ Integrated Web Terminal (40 seconds)
```
Click AI command → Executes on server →
View output → Ask AI to interpret
```
**Demo**: Execute remediation step via browser

### 5️⃣ Multi-LLM Support (10 seconds)
**Switch between**: Claude (best), GPT-4 (fast), Gemini (cost-effective), Ollama (private)
