Key Features Planned:
======================
✅ Natural language queries to monitoring data
✅ Real-time Prometheus metrics access
✅ Loki log aggregation queries
✅ Application health status analysis
✅ Historical data correlation
✅ LLM-powered query translation


Example Queries:
================
• "How many events for abc app in last 24 hours?"
  → 142 events (95 info, 35 warn, 12 error)

• "Was abc app healthy yesterday?"
  → Yes, 99.8% uptime, 0.4% error rate

• "Was the server impacted?"
  → Yes, CPU 95%, memory 92%


Implementation Timeline:
========================
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Phase 2: Historical Data (Weeks 3-4)
Phase 3: AI Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)
Phase 4: Query Translation (Weeks 7-8)
Phase 5: Integration (Weeks 9-10)
Phase 6: Polish (Weeks 11-12)

Total: 12 weeks (3 months)


Success Metrics:
================
Technical:
• Query accuracy: >85%
• Response time: <5s (p95)
• Cache hit rate: >60%
• Availability: >99.9%

Business:
• 20% MTTR reduction
• 30% self-service rate
• 15% fewer escalations
• 200-300% ROI (Year 1)


Status:
=======
✅ Planning Phase: COMPLETE
⏳ Implementation: Awaiting Approval
