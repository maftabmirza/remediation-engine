# AIOps Remediation Engine - User Guide

Welcome to the AIOps Remediation Engine! This platform helps Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and DevOps teams manage alerts, analyze root causes using AI, and remediate issues directly from the browser.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Accessing the Platform
Open your web browser and navigate to the deployed URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
-   **Default Admin Login**:
    -   Username: `admin`
    -   Password: (Check your `.env` file or ask your administrator)

### 2. The Dashboard
Upon logging in, you will see the **Dashboard**, which provides a high-level overview:
-   **Alert Statistics**: Total alerts, critical issues, and analysis status.
-   **Recent Activity**: A feed of the latest alerts and actions taken.

## 🔔 Managing Alerts

### Viewing Alerts
Click on **Alerts** in the navigation bar.
-   **Filter**: Use the search bar or status filters (Firing, Resolved) to find specific alerts.
-   **Severity**: Alerts are color-coded (Red for Critical, Orange for Warning).

### Analyzing an Alert
1.  Click on an alert to open the **Alert Detail View**.
2.  **AI Analysis**:
    -   If an **Auto-Analyze Rule** matched, the analysis will already be visible.
    -   If not, click the **"Analyze with AI"** button (or type in the chat) to trigger an on-demand analysis.
3.  **Review Insights**: The AI will provide:
    -   **Root Cause**: What went wrong.
    -   **Impact**: How it affects the system.
    -   **Remediation**: Step-by-step fix instructions.

## 🤖 Using the AI Assistant & Terminal

The Alert Detail view is split into two powerful panes:

### 1. AI Chat Assistant (Left Pane)
-   **Context-Aware**: The AI knows the details of the specific alert you are viewing.
-   **Interactive**: You can ask follow-up questions like "Where are the logs located?" or "Explain this error code."
-   **Command Generation**: The AI will suggest commands to run.

### 2. Web Terminal (Right Pane)
-   **Connect**: Click **"Connect"** in the top right of the terminal pane to select a server.
-   **Execute**: You can type commands manually or click the **"Run"** button on code blocks generated by the AI in the chat.
-   **Analyze Output**: After running a command, you can ask the AI to analyze the output by clicking **"Analyze Output"** or typing "Analyze the terminal output."

## ⚙️ Rules Engine

Automate your workflow by defining rules. Go to the **Rules** page.

### Creating a Rule
1.  Click **"New Rule"**.
2.  **Patterns**: Define patterns to match alerts. You can use wildcards (`*`).
    -   *Example*: `prod-db-*` matches `prod-db-01`, `prod-db-master`, etc.
3.  **Action**:
    -   **Auto-Analyze**: Immediately send to AI for analysis upon receipt.
    -   **Ignore**: Discard the alert (useful for noise reduction).
    -   **Manual**: Save the alert but wait for human intervention.
4.  **Priority**: Lower numbers are evaluated first.

## 🔧 Settings & Configuration

### LLM Providers
Go to **Settings** to manage AI models.
-   **Supported Providers**: Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT-4), Google (Gemini), Ollama (Local).
-   **Configuration**: Enter your API Key and select the model ID.
-   **Default**: Set one provider as the default for all auto-analyses.

### User Management
(Admin Only)
-   Create new users.
-   Reset passwords.
-   Assign roles (Admin/User).

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Connection Failed" in Terminal
-   Ensure the server credentials in **Settings > Servers** are correct.
-   Verify that the AIOps platform container has network access to the target server (port 22).

### "AI Analysis Failed"
-   Check if your API Key is valid in **Settings**.
-   Ensure you have sufficient credits/quota with your LLM provider.
-   Check the application logs if you are an administrator.

### Webhook Not Receiving Alerts
-   Verify your `alertmanager.yml` configuration points to the correct URL: `http://<platform-ip>:8080/webhook/alerts`.
-   Ensure the firewall allows traffic on port 8080.
